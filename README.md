# Curfew

#### Video Demo:

TODO

#### Description:

**A little game concept about getting home unnoticed written in Python**

##### Why?:

The CS50 course is my appetizer to the CS50 Game Development. This project signifies a move into that direction. The game does not need to be a full fleched game, but instead a prototype in which I work with the core concepts of gamemaking. The game will be in Python, so to apply the skill which I have learned over the last weeks, before moving on to LUA and C++.

##### Features:

- a movable character
- a collision system
- time tracking
- next level mechanics
- enemies

##### Features that will be nice to have:

- Character animations
- character and ambient sounds
- Story mode, dialogue in text bubbles
- variation of enemies such as guards and guard dogs
- lightning system
- movement tweaks, ramping up speeds, hide functionality
